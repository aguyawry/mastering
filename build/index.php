We'll fine tune the sonic balance, address any technical issues, and make sure your music sounds great across all systems and media formats. Projects come in many forms - singles, EPs, albums, soundtracks, compilations and even audio for video projects.</p></div></div><div class="col-mb-12 col-5 col-offset-2"><div class="service"><h3>Mastered for iTunes</h3><p>To be officially badged as <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/" class="text" rel="external">Mastered for iTunes</a>, the masters delivered to Apple must be created by an engineer on their official Mastered for iTunes Provider List. This ensures the engineer has followed Apple's protocols and the audio has been prepared for encoding in their AAC file format without error.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-group"><div class="col-mb-12 col-5"><div class="service"><h3>DDPi Masters</h3><p>If you are making CDs, a DDPi (Disc Description Protocol) is the ideal format for delivery of your record to the replication facility. It's an absolutely error-free master that creates a superior sounding CD which is also more reliable across a wide range of players.</p></div></div><div class="col-mb-12 col-5 col-offset-2"><div class="service"><h3>CD PreMasters (PMCD)</h3><p>A physical PreMaster CD is typically used in CD duplicaton where smaller runs of discs are being produced by burning and not stamping. We can create and error check the physical disc to ensure a quality master. We can also create additional CD reference discs for listening purposes only.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-group"><div class="col-mb-12 col-5"><div class="service"><h3>Digital Masters for Vinyl</h3><p>If you're cutting vinyl, there are sonic considerations to take into account in order to make sure your record translates well to the medium. We can also deliver high resolution files to your cutting house formatted correctly for the length of each side.</p></div></div><div class="col-mb-12 col-5 col-offset-2"><div class="service"><h3>Transfers and Restoration</h3><p>You may not be able to play your cassettes or DATs that have been sitting in the closet for a decade. The first step to preserving that audio is transferrring to a digital file. From there it's possible to do remove unwanted hum, hiss, pops and noise, and enhnace the audio in many ways.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-group"><div class="col-mb-12"><blockquote cite="https://coveredinbees.net/"><p>Scott is incredible to work with.
