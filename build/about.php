I have parents who were active in performance, conducting and education to thank for that.</p><p>Like many others, my first instrument was the piano and somewhere in middle school I started playing the guitar. It wasn't long before I ended up in the first of many bands and started spending a serious amount of time in studios.</p><p>My love of music grew into a love of audio and an affinity for gear used to create, capture and shape it. This led to a couple of <a href="https://www.ece.vt.edu/" rel="external">Electrical Engineering</a> degrees from <a href="http://www.vt.edu/" rel="external">Virginia Tech</a> along with a Music degree from <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" rel="external">Berklee College of Music</a>.</p><p>I landed at <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bob-ludwig-mn0000067819" rel="external">Bob Ludwig's</a> <a href="http://www.gatewaymastering.com/" rel="external">Gateway Mastering &amp; DVD</a> as a production engineer, began assisting with daily sessions and ultimately began taking on my own mastering projects. Gateway provided a wealth of knowledge and experience as I worked on everything from remastered classics to tomorrow's masterpieces and everything in between. Five years later I would build my own studio for the ultimate flexibility in the projects I could take on and the tools I use.</p><p>Today, I am fortunate to work with an abundance of artists, engineers and producers in various stages of their careers who provide a steady dose of new music from a wide range of genres. They trust both my critical and analytical listening skills as well as my ability to bridge the creative and technical worlds of music production. Technology allows us to collaborate despite potentially large geographical differences.</p><p>I am a voting member of both the <a href="http://www.aes.org/" rel="external">Audio Engineering Society (AES)</a> and <a href="http://www.grammy.com/" rel="external">The Recording Academy's</a> <a href="https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers" rel="external">Producers and Engineers Wing</a> (The Grammys). When I'm not working on projects for others, I still manage to get some guitar in and occasionally get <a href="http://scottelson.bandcamp.com/" rel="external">an idea or two</a> recorded.</p></section><section> <img class="studio" src="img/studio/mic.jpg" alt="Workhorse Microphone and Paul Reed Smith Custom 24"></section> <?php
