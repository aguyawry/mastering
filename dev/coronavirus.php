                <h2>Helping Artists Survive The Pandemic</h2>

                <p>In recent weeks, the coronavirus has devastated daily life for all of us. Loss of income, economic uncertainty and health concerns are taking their toll on everyone.</p>

                <p>Thousands of artists and musicians have been left with an unpredictable future as concerts are canceled, tours are postponed, and venues close down around the world.</p>

                <p>In an effort to help musicians whose lives have been significantly affected by the coronavirus, I am offering mastering services for a donation of any amount to anyone whose tour has been postponed or cancelled due to the recent coronavirus pandemic.</p>

                <p>The idea is that you've just lost a significant amount of income you were counting on from touring, and you're most likely not going to be touring for a while. Hopefully you will be able to generate some income by releasing new material, but you may not have the funds for mastering at the moment.</p>

                <p>My hope is that quality audio mastering shouldn't be a barrier to making your music available for purchase or streaming online right now. Maybe you also have connections in the TV or film industry and are able to get your music placed in those mediums as well.</p>

                <p>In the end, my goal is to provide you with great sounding music that you can use to start generating more income.</p>

                <p>I have many international clients and am able to work with anyone in the world. Since it appears we're all going to be on lockdown for a while, all you need is your music and a connection to the Internet.</p>

                <p>If this sounds like your situation, keep reading because I'd love to help.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <p>Once we connect, I can send more details about the process, but here are the basics to get things going:</p>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Read the rest of this page and click the button at the bottom. You'll be taken to a form and asked to provide a little information about you and your project.</li>

                    <li>Once you submit the form, I'll get notified and will reach out to you, typically within 3 to 5 business days. I'll let you know if your project is a fit and we'll discuss an expected turnaround time once I receive your audio.</li>

                    <li>Send me your mixes via my secure upload or a method of your choice. I am always happy to listen and give mix feedback before mastering if you have the opportunity to tweak your mixes.</li>

                    <li>I'll do the mastering for a single first so we can a get sonic baseline for your music. Then we can work on any remaining tracks after the mastering for your single has been approved.</li>

                    <li>Once mastering for all your mixes is completed and approved, I'll deliver your masters in any file format you'll need for digital distribution. That includes any high-quality sample rate and bit depth conversions if necessary.</li>
                </ul>
