                <h2>why you need mastering</h2>
                <p>Mastering is a blend of musical intuition, psychoacoustics, technology, and seasoned ears. It can add depth, punch, clarity, warmth and volume to your music.</p>
                
                <p>There are plenty of plugins with mastering presets available, and even automated services leveraging artificial intelligence, but here are some reasons you should have your music mastered by an experienced human like me.</p>

                    <h3>Fresh Ears</h3>
                    <p>Artists, producers and mixers can lose their objectivity after working on records for a long time. They count on me to bring fresh ears and an unbiased opinion to the project, with a simple focus on what's best for the music.</p>

                    <p>Fresh ears also means that as a mastering engieer, I listen to a lot of music across many genres in short periods of time. That allows me to have a pulse on a wide range of music production styles and sonic treatments.</p>

                    <h3>Cohesive Albums</h3>
                    <p>It's common for artists to record albums over the course of many months, in many studios, and with many engineers. Because of this, each mix will naturally sound different.</p>

                    <p>It's my job to address the sonics and dynamics of each track individually, making sure they work in relation to each other, and within the context of an entire album. The result is a cohesive experience that engages the listener from start to finish.</p>

                <h3>The Studio</h3>
                    <p>Many records are now made in home or project studios with unreliable acoustics, making the importance of mastering even more critical.</p>
                    
                    <p>My purpose-built studio provides an acoustically precise environment where accurate sonic decisions are made. My clean signal path and full range speakers produce incredible clarity, and often reveal issues clients may not have heard.</p>

                    <p>Some gear adds color while some is transparent. I only use what's needed and appropriate. Whether it's analog, digital, vintage or state of the art, each peice of gear is hand-picked for what it can bring to the music.</p>

                    <h3>Prep for Distribution</h3>
                    <p>Mastering is the final step in the creative process and the first step in the manufacturing process. The goal is to not only create the best sounding masters of your music, but to also get them in the correct format for distribution.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mastering is usually done at high resolution, but masters often need conversion and further preparation for delivery. No matter where your music is headed, I can create the right file in the right format from your masters. I also quality control everything that leaves the studio to make sure it's error free.</p>

                <p>My services are focused in two main areas - audio enhancement to create high-quality masters, and preparation of those masters for different distribution formats.</p>
                
                <p>While a lot can be accomplished in mastering, it's always best to start with a well-balanced mix. Along with the services below, I am always happy to offer complementary mix assessments for potential clients.</p>

                <p>Mastering projects come in many forms - singles, EPs, albums, soundtracks, compilations and audio for video. Upload a track via my DropBox account to get the process started.</p>

I'll fine tune the sonic balance of your mixes, address any technical issues, and make sure your music sounds great when played on any system and in any format.

                <p>I grew up with an appreciation for a wide range of music due to a family that was active in both performance and education. Early studies in piano eventually led me to the guitar, ongoing band memberships and an inclination to capture the music that surrounded me.</p>

My initial duties consisted of digital editing and creation of final production masters, but I was soon assisting in daily mastering sessions and eventually starting taking on mastering clients of my own.</p>

                <p>I founded elson mastering with the goal of making high-quality mastering available to artists of every stature. With a foundation tailored to the needs of audio and music production, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and creative feel to every record I am a part of.</p>
