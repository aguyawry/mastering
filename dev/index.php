                <p>Scott grew up with an appreciation for a wide range of music due to a family that was active in both performance and education. Early studies in piano eventually led to the guitar, ongoing band memberships and an inclination to capture the music that surrounded him.</p>

                <p>After completing degrees in both <a href="https://ece.vt.edu/" rel="external">Electrical Engineering</a> and <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" rel="external">Music</a>, Scott joined <a href="http://www.gatewaymastering.com/bob-ludwig/" rel="external">Bob Ludwig</a> at Gateway Mastering Studios in 2001 as a staff engineer. His initial duties consisted of digital editing and creation of final production masters, but he sas soon assisting in daily mastering sessions and eventually starting taking on mastering clients of his own.
                </p>

                <p>Scott founded elson mastering with the goal of making quality mastering available to artists of every stature. With a foundation tailored to the needs of audio and music production, he brings a unique combination of technical expertise and creative feel to every record he is a part of.</p>

                <p>Scott is a member of both the Audio Engineering Society and The Recording Academy’s Producers and Engineers Wing where he votes in the annual Grammy Awards.</p>
