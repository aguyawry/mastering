                <h3>audio mastering</h3>
                <p>After you've finished recording and mixing your music, it's time to add the final sonic touches with mastering.</p>
                
                 <p>Mastering is the art of balancing the sonic elements of your mixes, while also bringing out the best qualities of the music. It results in records that are sonically cohesive and have optimum playback across all systems and media formats.</p>

                <p>While a lot can be accomplished in mastering, it's always best to start with a well-balanced mix. I am always happy to do mix evaluations for clients and discuss any potential improvements that could be made before mastering begins.

                <p>Audio restoration involves removing unwanted imperfections from recordings while keeping the desired audio intact. It could be as simple as fixing a small mouth noise, or as complex as cleaning up a deteriorating record from the 1950s.</p>

                <p>The restoration process is delicate since the ear is usually happier with hiss, pops and clicks than it is with unnatural sonic artifacts left behind if not done properly. Part of the process is using good judgment and knowing when not to go too far.</p>

                <p>Restoration is typically a two step process.</p>

                <h4>Transfers</h4>

                <p>Physical media will deteriorate quickly. If you've got old DATs, cassettes, vinyl or even VHS tapes, their audio can be saved and brought back to life.</p>

                <p>The first step in restoring audio usually starts with preservation - by transferring it to a digital file. From there, it's possible to begin the repair or enhancement processes.</p>

                <p>Common annoyances like clicks, pops, hum, crackles, distortion and hiss can all be heavily mitigated or removed. Even noises like cell phone interference and rain can be cleaned up.</p>

                <p>Mastering is a blend of musical intuition, psychoacoustics, technology, and seasoned ears. It can add depth, punch, clarity, warmth and volume to your music.</p>
                
                <p>There are plenty of audio plugins with mastering presets available, and even automated audio mastering services leveraging artificial intelligence. While those tools may work in some cases, here are some reasons you should have your music mastered by an experienced human like me.</p>

                    <p>Artists, producers and mix engineers can lose their objectivity after working on records for a long time. They count on me to bring fresh ears and an unbiased opinion to the project, with a simple focus on what's best for the music.</p>

                    <p>Fresh ears also means that as a mastering engieer, I listen to a lot of music across many genres in short periods of time. That allows me to have a pulse on a wide range of music production styles and sonic treatments.</p>

                    <p>It's common for artists to record albums over the course of many months, in many studios, and with many engineers. Because of this, each mix will naturally sound different.</p>

                    <p>It's my job to address the sonics and dynamics of each track individually, making sure they work in relation to each other, and within the context of an entire album. The result is a cohesive experience that engages the listener from start to finish.</p>

                    <p>My purpose-built studio provides an acoustically precise environment where accurate sonic decisions are made. My clean signal path and full range speakers produce incredible clarity, and often reveal issues clients may not yet have even heard.</p>

                    <p>Audio will often need conversion and further preparation for delivery. No matter where your music is headed, I can create the right file in the right format. I also quality control everything that leaves the studio to make sure it's error free.</p>

                <p>I grew up with an appreciation for a wide range of music due to a family that was active in both performance and education. Early studies in piano eventually led me to the guitar, ongoing band memberships and an inclination to capture the music that surrounded me.</p>
                
                <p>After completing BS and MS degrees in <a class="text" href="https://ece.vt.edu/" rel="external">Electrical Engineering</a> from <a href="https://vt.edu/" rel="external">Virgnia Tech</a>, I went on to study both <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/guitar" rel="external">Guitar</a> and <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/mpe" rel="external">Music Production & Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.berklee.edu/" rel="external">Berklee College of Music</a>.</p>
                
                <p>I then joined <a class="text" href="http://www.gatewaymastering.com/bob-ludwig/" rel="external">Bob Ludwig</a> at Gateway Mastering Studios as a staff engineer. My initial duties consisted of digital editing and creation of final production masters, but I was soon assisting in daily mastering sessions and eventually starting taking on mastering clients of my own.</p>

                <p>I founded elson mastering with the goal of making high-quality mastering available to artists of every stature. With a foundation tailored to the needs of audio and music production, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and creative feel to every record I am a part of.</p>

                <p>Over the years, artists at every stage in their career have trusted me to put the finishing touches on their records. My commitment to always serve the music comes through in every project.</p>

                <p>I am a member of both the <a class="text" href="http://www.aes.org/" rel="external">Audio Engineering Society</a> and <a class="text" href="https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy" rel="external">The Recording Academy’s</a> <a class="text" href="https://www.grammy.com/recording-academy/membership/recording-academy/about/chapters/producers-engineers-wing" rel="external">Producers and Engineers Wing</a> where I vote in the annual <a class="text" href="https://www.grammy.com/" rel="external">Grammy Awards</a>.</p>
