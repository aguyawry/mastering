                <h2>why mastering</h2>

                <p>Mastering is a blend of musical intuition, psychoacoustics, technology, and seasoned ears. It can add depth, punch, clarity, warmth and volume to your music.</p>
                
                <p>There are plenty of plugins with mastering presets available, and even automated audio mastering services leveraging artificial intelligence. Here are some reasons you should have your music mastered by an experienced human like me.</p>

                    <h3>fresh ears</h3>

                    <p>Artists, producers and mixers can lose their objectivity after working on records for a long time. They count on me to bring fresh ears and an unbiased opinion to the project, with a simple focus on what's best for the music.</p>

                    <p>Fresh ears also means that as a mastering engieer, I listen to a lot of music across many genres in short periods of time. That allows me to have a pulse on a wide range of music production styles and sonic treatments.</p>

                    <h3>cohesive albums</h3>
                    <p>It's common for artists to record albums over the course of many months, in many studios, and with many engineers. Because of this, each mix will naturally sound different.</p>

                    <p>It's my job to address the sonics and dynamics of each track individually, making sure they work in relation to each other, and within the context of an entire album. The result is a cohesive experience that engages the listener from start to finish.</p>

                    <h3>the studio</h3>
                    <p>Many records are now made in home or project studios with unreliable acoustics, making the importance of mastering even more critical.</p>
                    
                    <p>My purpose-built studio provides an acoustically precise environment where accurate sonic decisions are made. My clean signal path and full range speakers produce incredible clarity, and often reveal issues clients may not have heard.</p>

                    <p>Some gear adds color while some is transparent. I only use what's needed and appropriate. Whether it's analog, digital, vintage or state of the art, each peice of gear is hand-picked for what it can bring to the music.</p>

                    <p>Mastering is the final step in the creative process and the first step in the manufacturing process. The goal is to not only create the best sounding masters of your music, but to also get them in the correct format for distribution.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mastering is usually done at high resolution, but masters often need conversion and further preparation for delivery. No matter where your music is headed, I can create the right file in the right format from your masters. I also quality control everything that leaves the studio to make sure it's error free.</p>

                <h3>mastering</h3>
                <p>Mastering is the process of balancing the sonic elements of your mixes, while also bringing out the best qualities of the music. It results in records that are sonically cohesive and have optimum playback across all systems and media formats.</p> 
                    
                <p>Mastering projects come in many forms - singles, EPs, albums, soundtracks, compilations and audio for video. While a lot can be accomplished in mastering, it's always best to start with a well-balanced mix.</p>

                <h4>Digital</h4>

                <p>Most mastering projects will target some form of digital distribution.</p>
                
                <p>While the CD is slowly heading toward niche status, streaming services rule the day and digital video projects are also common.</p>
                
                <p>Each digital destination has its own nuances, and knowing the ultimate destination ahead of time allows for optimization during mastering.</p>

                <h4>Vinyl</h4>

                <p>Vinyl is definitely making a comeback with more releases targeting the format every day.</p>
                
                <p>Mastering targeting digital distribution <em>may</em> also work for vinyl, but mastering tailored for vinyl is sometimes the right choice to bring out the best in the format.</p>

                <p>For clients who can't seem to get their mixes just right, stem mastering may be an option.</p>
                
                <p>Instead of sending a full mix, you can break the mix down into components such as bass, drums, lead vocals - which can then be adjusted individually during playback in mastering.</p>
                
                <p>It can be bit more complicated, but sometimes more rewarding.</p>

                <h3>restoration</h3>

                <p>Audio restoration and repair involves removing unwanted imperfections from recordings while keeping the desired audio intact. It could be as simple as fixing a small mouth noise, or as complex as cleaning up a deteriorating record from the 1950s.</p>

                <p>The restoration process is delicate since the ear is usually happier with hiss, pops and clicks than it is with sonic artifacts left behind if not done properly. Part of the process is using good judgment and knowing when not to go too far.</p>

                <p>Physical media will deteriorate quickly. If you've got old DATs, cassettes, vinyl or even VHS tapes, it can be saved and brought back to life.</p>

                <p>The first step in restoring audio sometimes starts with preservation by transferring it to a digital file. From there, it's possible to begin the repair or enhancement process.</p>

                <p>I grew up with an appreciation for a wide range of music due to a family that was active in both performance and education. Early studies in piano eventually led me to the guitar, ongoing band memberships and an inclination to capture the music that surrounded me.</p>

                <p>After completing degrees in both <a class="text" href="https://ece.vt.edu/" rel="external">Electrical Engineering</a> and <a class="text" href="https://www.berklee.edu/" rel="external">Music</a>, I joined <a class="text" href="http://www.gatewaymastering.com/bob-ludwig/" rel="external">Bob Ludwig</a> at Gateway Mastering Studios in 2001 as a staff engineer. My initial duties consisted of digital editing and creation of final production masters, but I was soon assisting in daily mastering sessions and eventually starting taking on mastering clients of my own.</p>

                <p>I founded elson mastering with the goal of making high-quality mastering available to artists of every stature. With a foundation tailored to the needs of audio and music production, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise and creative feel to every record I am a part of.</p>

                <p>Over the years, artists at every stage in their career have trusted me to put the finishing touches on their records. My commitment to always serve the music comes through in every project.</p>
