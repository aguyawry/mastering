                    <p>Scott is my first call for mastering. For all his technical mastery, he never loses sight of the music.</p>
                    <p>I can flow seamlessly with him between technical and musical issues, and never have to explain what I mean.</p>
                    <p>He adopts the project as a contributor, with an authentic interest in helping me fulfill and exceed the expectations of my artists and clients.</p>

                    <p>Even though the material we presented him with was recorded in a very DIY manner, he managed to pull out albums that sound like real albums.</p>
