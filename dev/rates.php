                <p>Mastering is the actual process of enhancing your mixes so they sound the best they possibly can. All unattended mastering rates include:</p>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Mix Assessments</strong><br>The best masters start with the best mixes. If you are unsure about your mixes, I am happy to give them a listen and provide feedback on potential enhancements.</li>

                    <li><strong>File Transfers</strong><br>You can easily send your mixes to me by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/2uWQA59djx11nEK5yTZh" rel="external">uploading them via my secure DropBox account</a>. I deliver all mastered audio via DropBox as well.</li>

                    <li><strong>Session Set Up</strong><br>The time it takes to set up my gear and prepare your audio for the mastering session.</li>

                    <li><strong>High Resolution Files</strong><br>All mastering is done at high resolution. Any other file formats you need will be created from these high resolution masters.</li>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Format Conversions</strong><br>It's possible you'll need different file formats for various purposes - like 44.1 kHz / 16 bit files for streaming services or 48 kHz / 24 bit for video.</li>

                    <li><strong>Revisions</strong><br>Most projects don't require revisions, but if you do want to tweak something, all revisions are free as long as they are requested within 30 days of masters being delivered. Further revisions are billed hourly at attended mastering rates.</li>

                    <li><strong>Archives</strong><br>While I highly recommend making multiple copies of your mastered audio and keeping them in different places, I'll keep your audio archived for a minimum of two years.</li>

                <p>In most cases, your mastered audio will work for both digital distribution and vinyl, but mastering for vinyl does require special consideration in order to bring out the full warmth and sonic range of the format.</p>

                <p>At the end of the day, listening to records is a mechanical process, so there are many variables at play.</p>

                <p>If you do need separate mastering for vinyl, it's typically a variation on the settings that were used for digital distribution, so there is already a sonic starting point.</p>

                <p>While many of the issues noted here are addressed during the normal mastering process, some of them are also stylistic elements found in certain musical generes. They could be reasons you may need separate masters for vinyl.</p>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Excessive limiting and compression to achieve high levels can end up distorting on vinyl. It will ultimately have the opposite effect since the engineer will be forced to cut at a lower volume which will also increase the perceived noise floor.</li>
                    <li>Sudden and drastic panning, or extreme sweeps between left and right channels could be problematic.</li>
                    <li>Excessive low frequencies may need taming to help with groove tracking and create a cleaner cut. Low frequencies should also be all or mostly centered in the mix.</li>
                    <li>Excessive high frequencies may need taming since they could distort on vinyl and could possibly even damage the head on the cutting lathe.</li>
                    <li>Excessive sibilance, like the "ssssss" sound, can cause distortion when cutting vinyl. Sometimes the letters "t" and "z" can cause sibilance as well. </li>

                <p>I follow Apple's protocols for mastering engineers by encoding all Mastered for iTunes tracks using Apple's AAC iTunes+ Codec to ensure they are free of clipping. The encoded files are also auditioned to make sure there are no audible distortions induced from encoding.</p>

                <p>Your mixes must be delivered to mastering in a 24 bit format. Mastered audio will be delivered at 24 bit for sending to iTunes.</p>
