                <p>Please find rates for services below. I realize every project is unique and I will do my best to work with your budget, so don't hesitate to reach out.<p>

                <h3>Mastering</h3>

                <p>All mastering rates include:</p>

            <div class="col-mb-12 col-6">

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Mix Assessments</strong><br>The best place to start in mastering is with a good mix. If you are unsure about your mixes, I am happy to give them a listen and provide feedback on potential enhancements.</li>

                    <li><strong>File Transfers</strong><br>You can easily send your mixes to me by uploading them via my DropBox account. I'll deliver all mastered audio the same way.</li>

                    <li><strong>Session Set Up</strong><br>The time it takes to set up my gear and prepare your audio for the mastering session.</li>

                    <li><strong>High Resolution Files</strong><br>All mastering is done at high resolution. Any other file formats you need will be created from these.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="col-mb-12 col-6">
                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Sample Rate / Bit Depth Conversions</strong><br>It's possible you'll need different file formats for various purposes - like 44.1 kHz / 16 bit files for streaming services or 48 kHz / 24 bit for video.</li>

                    <li><strong>Two Rounds of Revisions</strong><br>Most projects don't require revisions, but I'll include up to 2 revisions per track. Further revisions are billed hourly at $150/hr.</li>

                    <li><strong>Archives</strong><br>While I highly recommend making mutliple copies of your mastered audio and keeping them in different places, I'll keep your audio archived for two years just in case.</li>

                    <li><strong>Communications</strong><br>Email correspondence, video chat, phone calls...</li>
