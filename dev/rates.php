                <p>Mastering is the actual process of enhancing your mixes so they sound the best they possibly can. All unattended mastering rates include:</p>

                    <li><strong>Mix Assessments</strong><br>The best masters start with the best mixes. If you are unsure about your mixes, I am happy to give them a listen and provide feedback on potential enhancements.</li>

                    <li><strong>File Transfers</strong><br>You can easily send your mixes to me by <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/2uWQA59djx11nEK5yTZh" rel="external">uploading them via my secure DropBox account</a>. I deliver all mastered audio via DropBox as well.</li>

                    <li><strong>Session Set Up</strong><br>The time it takes to set up my gear and prepare your audio for the mastering session.</li>

                    <li><strong>High Resolution Files</strong><br>All mastering is done at high resolution. Any other file formats you need will be created from these high resolution masters.</li>

                    <li><strong>Format Conversions</strong><br>It's possible you'll need different file formats for various purposes - like 44.1 kHz / 16 bit files for streaming services or 48 kHz / 24 bit for video.</li>

                <p>In most cases, your mastered audio will work for both digital distribution and vinyl, but mastering for vinyl does require special consideration in order to bring out the full warmth and sonic range of the format.</p>

                <p>At the end of the day, listening to records is a mechanical process, so there are many variables at play.</p>

                <p>If you do need separate mastering for vinyl, it's typically a variation on the settings that were used for digital distribution, so there is already a sonic starting point.</p>

                <p>While many of the issues noted here are addressed during the normal mastering process, some of them are also stylistic elements found in certain musical generes. They could be reasons you may need separate masters for vinyl.</p>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li>Excessive limiting and compression to achieve high levels can end up distorting on vinyl. It will ultimately have the opposite effect since the engineer will be forced to cut at a lower volume which will also increase the perceived noise floor.</li>
                    <li>Sudden and drastic panning, or extreme sweeps between left and right channels could be problematic.</li>
                    <li>Excessive low frequencies may need taming to help with groove tracking and create a cleaner cut. Low frequencies should also be all or mostly centered in the mix.</li>
                    <li>Excessive high frequencies may need taming since they could distort on vinyl and could possibly even damage the head on the cutting lathe.</li>
                    <li>Excessive sibilance, like the "ssssss" sound, can cause distortion when cutting vinyl. Sometimes the letters "t" and "z" can cause sibilance as well. </li>

                <p>For clients making Compact Discs, I create a DDPi (Disc Description Protocol image) for delivery to a replication facility. It's the ideal format for an absolutely error-free master, creating a superior sounding CD which is also more reliable across a wide range of players.</p>

                <p>Tracks will be sequenced in your desired order with the appropriate gaps, fades or crossfades. Any optional metadata such as ISRC codes and CD-Text information can also be added. This is all then combined into a digital image of the Compact Disc.</p>
                
                <p>Clients can download the exact same image and listen to it with my included software player, which also allows them to burn their own reference discs.</p>
