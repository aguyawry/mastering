                <p>Mastering is the actual process of enhancing your mixes so they sound the best they possibly can.</p>

                <!-- <p>You'll find reduced rates for returning clients, and I also offer a 10% discount on your next mastering project if you refer a new client who ends up booking an album mastering project with me.</p> -->

                <p>All mastering rates include:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-mb-12 col-6">

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Mix Assessments</strong><br>The best masters start with the best mixes. If you are unsure about your mixes, I'm happy to give them a listen and provide feedback on potential enhancements.</li>

                    <li><strong>File Transfers</strong><br>You can easily send your mixes to me by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRl-3iEdEjnBY-nkt4EVg7_G7fmbpjIVFsR4kXufrYEDsK_A/viewform" rel="external">uploading them via my secure file transfer</a>. I deliver all mastered audio the same way.</li>

                    <li><strong>Session Set Up</strong><br>Before each session there is some time spent recalibrating gear, preparing source mixes for mastering and other housekeeping tasks to get everything ready to go for the session.</li>

                    <li><strong>Revisions</strong><br>I'm not happy until you're happy and I will work with you on your original mixes until you are satisfied at no additional charge. While tweaks are rare, if you do want to make them, it's always free.</li>

                    <li><strong>High Resolution Files</strong><br>All mastering is done at the highest resolution that makes sense. This is typically 24 bit and the same sample rate of your mixes. Any different file formats you need will be created from the high resolution masters.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="list-bullet">
                    <li><strong>Format Conversions</strong><br>Once masters have been approved, it's possible you'll need different file formats for various purposes. Some streaming services accept 44.1 kHz / 16 bit files - some prefer 24 bit. Audio for video is typically 48 kHz / 24 bit. I have tools for high quality conversions to any format you'll need.</li>

                    <li><strong>Quality Control</strong><br>All audio that leaves the studio is quality controlled - meaning it's listened to by a human to ensure it's as intended and free of sonic anomalies. All clients are encouraged to take a careful listen as well before approving final masters.</li>

                    <li><strong>Archives</strong><br>While I highly recommend making multiple copies of your mastered audio and keeping them in different places, I'll keep your audio archived for a minimum of two years.</li>

                    <li><strong>Comms</strong><br>Efficient and effective communication is important to me. I am always accessible for 1 on 1 conversations with clients about mixes and masters in whatever form works best.</li>

                <p>I always strive to create dynamic and sonically balanced tracks, so it's possible your mastered audio will work for both digital distribution and vinyl.</p>
                    
                <p>However, mastering for vinyl does require special consideration in order to bring out the full warmth and sonic range of the format.</p>

                <p>At the end of the day, listening to records is a mechanical process, so there are many variables at play.</p>

                <p>If you do need separate mastering for vinyl, it's typically a variation on the settings that were used for digital distribution, so there is already a sonic starting point.</p>

                <p>While many of the issues noted here are addressed during the normal mastering process, some of them are also stylistic elements found in certain musical genres. They could be reasons you may need separate masters for vinyl.</p>

                    <li>Excessive limiting and compression to achieve high levels can end up distorting on vinyl. It will ultimately have the opposite effect since the engineer will be forced to cut at a lower volume which will also increase the perceived noise floor.</li>

                    <li>Sudden and drastic panning, or extreme sweeps between left and right channels could be problematic.</li>

                    <li>Excessive low frequencies may need taming to help with groove tracking and create a cleaner cut. Low frequencies should also be all or mostly centered in the mix.</li>

                    <li>Excessive high frequencies may need taming since they could distort on vinyl and could possibly even damage the head on the cutting lathe.</li>

                    <li>Excessive sibilance, like the "ssssss" sound, can cause distortion when cutting vinyl. Sometimes the letters "t" and "z" can cause sibilance as well. </li>

                <p>I am an Apple approved Mastered for iTunes (MFiT) engineer.</p>

                <p>For a release to be officially badged as "Mastered for iTunes", the masters delivered to iTunes must be created by an engineer on their official MFiT Provider List.</p>

                <p>You <em>do not</em> need MFiT files to release your music on iTunes - only if you want your release to have the official "Mastered for iTunes" badge.</p>

                <p>I follow Apple's required protocols for mastering engineers by encoding all tracks using Apple's AAC iTunes+ Codec to ensure they are free of clipping. The encoded files are then auditioned to make sure there are no audible distortions.</p>

                <p>Your mixes must be delivered to mastering at a minimum of 44.1 kHz / 24 bit. Mastered audio will be returned at 24 bit for delivery to iTunes who will then encode them.</p>

                <p>Vinyl Production Masters are typically a single high resolution digital audio file for each side of the record. It's sent to your vinyl cutting house along with a track list containing detailed timing information.</p>
                
                <p>Due to physical differences between the outer and inner parts of the disc, the order of your tracks is an important consideration with vinyl.</p>

                <p>A great rule of thumb is to put your loudest, heaviest tracks with more frequency information at the beginning of each side, and put your less dynamic tracks with less frequency information at the end of each side.</p>

                <p>Also in play is how much audio can fit on a side. That can vary depending on the record size (12", 10", 7"), record speed (33 1/3 rpm, 45 rpm, 78 rpm) and desired loudness.</p>
            
                <p>It's not uncommon for the vinyl release of an album to have a slightly different track order vs the digital release.</p>

                <p>In some cases, tracks may be edited or even left off the vinyl release to achieve a shorter playing time, or to get each side equal in length.</p>
            
                <p>With a little forward planning and some consultation with the cutting house, we can maximize the potential of your vinyl and produce the best release possible.</p>

                <p>For clients making Compact Discs, I create a DDPi (Disc Description Protocol image) for delivery to a replication facility.</p>
                
                <p>It's the ideal format for an absolutely error-free master, creating a superior sounding CD which is also more reliable across a wide range of players.</p>

                <p>Tracks are sequenced in your desired order with the appropriate gaps, fades and crossfades. Any optional metadata such as <a href="https://www.usisrc.org/" rel="external">ISRC codes</a> and <a href="http://web.ncf.ca/aa571/cdtext.htm" rel="external">CD-Text</a> information can also be added.</p>

                <p>This is all combined into a digital image of the Compact Disc. Also included is a track list containing detailed timing information.</p>
                
                <p>Clients can download the exact same image and listen to it with my included software player, which also allows them to burn their own reference discs.</p>

                <p>A PreMaster CD (PMCD) is a specially formatted, recordable Compact Disc designed to be sent to a CD pressing plant for replication.</p>

                <p>I <strong><em>do not</em></strong> recommend using this format for making Compact Discs, but in some cases it may be necessary.</p>

                <p>If your manufacturer cannot accept a DDPi, it is still possible to create a PMCD using high quality drives and CD-R media.</p>

                <p>The PreMaster is quality controlled by both listening to it and running a check on the physical layer of the disc. Once that's done, it shouldn't be played or handled to prevent any scratching, fingerprints or other damage.</p>

                <p>I can also create CD References which are burned on the same quality media, but are not quality controlled. Clients can burn CD References themselves using my software CD image player. These should only be used for listening and not as production masters.</p>

                <p>Making a PMCD is a little more expensive due to the extra time taken for quality control and shipping. A DDPi is highly recommended instead.</p>

                <p>Physical media will deteriorate quickly. If you've got old DATs, cassettes, vinyl or even VHS tapes, it can be saved and brought back to life.</p>

                <p>The first step to restoring audio is preserving it by transferring to digital. From there, it's possible to enhance the audio in many ways.</p>

                <p>Restoration projects are not only music focused, but have also included forensic applications for law enforcement and private investigation.</p>

                <p>I have training in proper evidence handling, enhancement, analysis and interpretation from the <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/CAM/Centers/ncmf/Pages/ncmf.aspx" rel="external">National Center for Media Forensics</a>.</p>

                <p>Restoration projects can vary greatly in scope and are quoted per project. Please get in touch to discuss your specific needs.</p>

                <p>Basic digital audio editing is included in both the mastering process and creation of production masters. Sometimes more involved editing is requested for a variety of reasons.</p>

                <p>In a mastering context, clients often ask for new or different versions of their mastered audio. Common requests are to create shorter and also "clean" versions of songs for radio play.</p>

                <p>Sometimes clients send a number of different mixes of the same song to be mastered - vocal up mix, instrumental mix, snare up mix or more. After mastering all versions, they may want to edit together sections from each to create a new version.</p>
                
                <p>In all cases, audio editing needs to be seamless and totally transparent to the listener.</p>
